Thinkwell provides a TypeScript API for integrating AI agents into your applications. The library connects to AI coding agents via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and provides a fluent interface for building prompts, managing sessions, and handling typed responses.

## Module Structure

Thinkwell exports its API through two subpaths:

### Main Types (`thinkwell:agent`)

```typescript
import { Agent, Session } from "thinkwell:agent";
```

| Type | Produced By | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `Agent` | `Agent.connect()` | Main entry point for connecting to AI agents |
| `Session` | `agent.createSession()` | Manages multi-turn conversations with persistent context |
| `ThinkBuilder` | `agent.think()` | Fluent API for building prompts with tools |

### Connectors (`thinkwell:connectors`)

```typescript
import { CLAUDE_CODE, CODEX, GEMINI, OPENCODE, AUGMENT, KIRO } from "thinkwell:connectors";
```

Pre-configured connector strings for popular AI agents. See [Connectors](/api/connectors) for details.

## Architecture

Thinkwell follows a layered architecture:

1. **Agent** - Establishes a connection to an AI agent via ACP. Create one with `Agent.connect()`.

2. **Sessions** - Agents support two interaction modes:
   - **Ephemeral**: Use `agent.think()` for single-turn interactions
   - **Persistent**: Use `agent.createSession()` for multi-turn conversations

3. **ThinkBuilder** - A fluent API for constructing prompts. Chain methods to build content, then call `.run()` to execute.

## Structured Output with @JSONSchema

Thinkwell uses the `@JSONSchema` JSDoc tag to define expected AI output structures. The CLI generates JSON Schemas from your TypeScript interfaces at build time:

```typescript
/**
 * Analysis result from code review.
 * @JSONSchema
 */
export interface AnalysisResult {
  /** List of issues found */
  issues: Array<{
    severity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
    description: string;
  }>;
  /** Overall summary */
  summary: string;
}

// The schema is available as a static property
const result = await agent.think(AnalysisResult.Schema).text("...").run();
```

JSDoc comments become `description` fields in the generated schema, helping the AI understand what each field should contain.
